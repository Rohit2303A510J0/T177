# 📘 T177 – Classroom Monitoring System for Skill Training Programs

## 🧠 Problem Statement

**Domain:** Student Innovation  
**Title:** Monitoring System for Classroom Session in Skill Training Programme  

### 📌 Background
In the context of the Skill Development Training Program, there is a growing need for a **robust automated monitoring system** to assess and enhance the effectiveness of classroom training. This system will help with the **early detection of below-average training institutions**, enabling timely interventions.

### 🎯 Description
The goal is to create a system capable of **analyzing classroom images** to identify the types of **activities and interactions** taking place during training sessions.  
By understanding these activities, we can better assess the **quality and relevance** of the training content delivered.

A dataset comprising images of classrooms across various **job roles**, along with **course curriculum**, **infrastructure requirements**, and other metadata, will be provided.

---

### ✅ Expected Solution
- This is only the algorithm implementation of checking to flag sessions and the image analysis part is ommited as no dynamic coding required.
- The system should **flag sessions** needing **enhanced monitoring** or even **cancellation**.
